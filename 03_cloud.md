Cloud Knowledge and Skills Evaluation
Objective
The objective of this mini project is to evaluate your proficiency in using AWS, Azure,
and GCP for various cloud computing tasks.
You will be required to perform tasks involving resource creation, management, and
automation.
Project Tasks
Basic Questions
Create an S3 Bucket on AWS
Task: Create an S3 bucket named <your_name>-s3-bucket and upload a sample file to
the bucket. Make the file publicly accessible.
Deliverable: Provide the URL of the uploaded file and the commands or steps used to
create the bucket and upload the file.
Launch a Virtual Machine on Azure
Task: Create a virtual machine in Azure named <your_name>-vm using the Ubuntu
18.04 LTS image. Configure the VM with a public IP address.
Deliverable: Provide the public IP address of the VM and the commands or steps used
to create it.
Create a Storage Bucket on GCP
Task: Create a storage bucket named <your_name>-gcp-bucket in GCP and upload a
sample file to the bucket. Make the file publicly accessible.
Deliverable: Provide the URL of the uploaded file and the commands or steps used to
create the bucket and upload the file.
Intermediate Questions
Set Up a Web Server on AWS EC2
Task: Launch an EC2 instance using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI. Install and configure
Apache web server to serve a simple HTML page.
Deliverable: Provide the public IP address of the EC2 instance, the URL of the served
HTML page, and the commands or steps used to set up the web server.

Deploy a Web App on Azure App Service
Task: Create an Azure App Service instance and deploy a simple web application (e.g., a
Flask app) to it.
Deliverable: Provide the URL of the deployed web application and the commands or
steps used to create the App Service and deploy the app.
Set Up a Cloud Function on GCP
Task: Create a Cloud Function on GCP that triggers on HTTP requests and returns a
smple JSON response.
Deliverable: Provide the URL of the Cloud Function and the commands or steps used to
create and deploy the function.
Create a Relational Database on AWS RDS
Task: Create an RDS instance using MySQL. Configure the database with a username
and password, and create a sample database.
Deliverable: Provide the endpoint of the RDS instance and the commands or steps used
to create and configure the database.
Deploy a SQL Database on Azure
Task: Create an Azure SQL Database instance and configure it with a sample database.
Deliverable: Provide the server name, database name, and the commands or steps
used to create and configure the database.
Advanced Questions
Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster on GCP
Task: Create a GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) cluster with a minimum of 3 nodes.
Deploy a simple web application to the cluster.
Deliverable: Provide the external IP address of the deployed application and the
commands or steps used to create the cluster and deploy the application.
Set Up a VPC with Public and Private Subnets on AWS
Task: Create a VPC with a public and a private subnet. Launch an EC2 instance in each
subnet. Ensure the instance in the public subnet can be accessed via SSH, and the
instance in the private subnet can access the internet through a NAT gateway.
Deliverable: Provide the VPC ID, subnet IDs, and the commands or steps used to create
the VPC, subnets, and instances.

Create a Virtual Network with Subnets on Azure
Task: Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) with two subnets: one public and one
private. Launch a virtual machine in each subnet. Ensure the VM in the public subnet
can be accessed via SSH, and the VM in the private subnet can access the internet
through a NAT gateway.
Deliverable: Provide the VNet name, subnet names, and the commands or steps used
to create the VNet, subnets, and VMs.
Set Up a VPC Network on GCP
Task: Create a VPC network on GCP with two subnets: one public and one private.
Launch a virtual machine in each subnet. Ensure the VM in the public subnet can be
accessed via SSH, and the VM in the private subnet can access the internet through a
Cloud NAT.
Deliverable: Provide the VPC network name, subnet names, and the commands or
steps used to create the VPC network, subnets, and VMs.
Implement Load Balancing on AWS
Task: Set up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) on AWS to distribute traffic between two
EC2 instances running a web server.
Deliverable: Provide the DNS name of the ELB and the commands or steps used to
create and configure the load balancer and EC2 instances.
Set Up Azure Load Balancer
Task: Create an Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic between two virtual machines
running a web server.
Deliverable: Provide the public IP address of the load balancer and the commands or
steps used to create and configure the load balancer and virtual machines.
Configure Cloud NAT on GCP
Task: Set up Cloud NAT on GCP to allow instances in a private subnet to access the
internet.
Deliverable: Provide the NAT gateway name and the commands or steps used to create
and configure the Cloud NAT.
