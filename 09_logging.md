Monitoring and Logging Skills Evaluation
Objective
The objective of this mini project is to evaluate your proficiency in setting up and using
various monitoring and logging tools. You will be required to perform tasks involving
Prometheus and Grafana, AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitoring, Azure Log Analytics
Workspace, and GCP monitoring technologies.
Prometheus and Grafana
Setting Up Prometheus
Task: Set up Prometheus on a local machine or cloud instance.
Deliverable: Provide the steps and configuration files used to set up Prometheus.
Configuring Prometheus to Monitor a Sample Application
Task: Deploy a sample application (e.g., a simple Node.js or Python app) and configure
Prometheus to scrape metrics from it.
Deliverable: Provide the sample application code, Prometheus configuration file, and
steps taken to set up monitoring.
Setting Up Grafana
Task: Set up Grafana on the same instance as Prometheus or a different one.
Deliverable: Provide the steps and configuration files used to set up Grafana.
Creating Grafana Dashboards
Task: Create a Grafana dashboard that visualizes metrics from the sample application
monitored by Prometheus.
Deliverable: Provide the steps to create the dashboard and a screenshot of the final
dashboard.
AWS CloudWatch
Setting Up AWS CloudWatch for EC2 Monitoring
Task: Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor an EC2 instance. Configure CloudWatch to
collect CPU, memory, and disk usage metrics.
Deliverable: Provide the steps and screenshots of the CloudWatch dashboard
displaying the metrics.

Creating CloudWatch Alarms
Task: Create CloudWatch alarms for CPU utilization exceeding a threshold (e.g., 80%)
on the monitored EC2 instance.
Deliverable: Provide the steps to create the alarms and screenshots of the alarm
configuration.
Setting Up CloudWatch Logs
Task: Configure an application running on the EC2 instance to send logs to CloudWatch
Logs. Set up log retention policies.
Deliverable: Provide the steps and configuration files used to set up CloudWatch Logs
and screenshots of the logs in the CloudWatch console.
Azure Monitoring and Log Analytics
Setting Up Azure Monitor for VM Monitoring
Task: Set up Azure Monitor to monitor a virtual machine (VM) in Azure. Configure it to
collect CPU, memory, and disk usage metrics.
Deliverable: Provide the steps and screenshots of the Azure Monitor dashboard
displaying the metrics.
Creating Azure Monitor Alerts
Task: Create Azure Monitor alerts for CPU utilization exceeding a threshold (e.g., 80%)
on the monitored VM.
Deliverable: Provide the steps to create the alerts and screenshots of the alert
configuration.
Setting Up Azure Log Analytics Workspace
Task: Set up an Azure Log Analytics Workspace and configure it to collect logs from the
monitored VM.
Deliverable: Provide the steps and screenshots of the logs in the Log Analytics
Workspace.
Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging
Setting Up Google Cloud Monitoring for VM Instances
Task: Set up Google Cloud Monitoring to monitor a Compute Engine instance. Configure
it to collect CPU, memory, and disk usage metrics.
Deliverable: Provide the steps and screenshots of the Google Cloud Monitoring
dashboard displaying the metrics.

Creating Google Cloud Monitoring Alerts
Task: Create Google Cloud Monitoring alerts for CPU utilization exceeding a threshold
(e.g., 80%) on the monitored instance.
Deliverable: Provide the steps to create the alerts and screenshots of the alert
configuration.
Setting Up Google Cloud Logging
Task: Configure an application running on the Compute Engine instance to send logs to
Google Cloud Logging. Set up log retention policies.
Deliverable: Provide the steps and configuration files used to set up Google Cloud
Logging and screenshots of the logs in the Google Cloud Console.
Advanced Questions
Integrating Prometheus with CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Monitoring
Task: Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and
Google Cloud Monitoring using respective exporters.
Deliverable: Provide the steps and configuration files used to integrate Prometheus with
each cloud monitoring service.
Creating a Unified Grafana Dashboard
Task: Create a unified Grafana dashboard that visualizes metrics from Prometheus
(monitoring the sample application and cloud metrics), AWS CloudWatch, Azure
Monitor, and Google Cloud Monitoring.
Deliverable: Provide the steps to create the unified dashboard and a screenshot of the
final dashboard.
